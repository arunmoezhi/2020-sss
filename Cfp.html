<p>
The 22th International Symposium on Stabilization, Safety, and
Security of Distributed Systems (SSS 2020) will be held in Austin, Texas, USA
on November 18-21, 2020.
</p>
<p>
SSS is an international forum for researchers and practitioners in the
design and development of distributed systems with a focus on systems
that are able to provide guarantees on their structure, performance,
and/or security in the face of an adverse operational environment. The
symposium encourages submissions of original contributions on
fundamental research and practical applications concerning topics in
the four symposium tracks:
</p>
<h5 class="utdallas">Track A. Self-Stabilization</h5>
Self-stabilizing systems
</br>
Variants of Self-stabilization
</br>
Topological Stabilization
</br>
Autonomous Systems
</br>
Stabilization and self-* properties in hardware, software, and middleware design
</br>
Self-stabilizing software defined infrastructure

<h5 class="utdallas">Track B.  Foundations of Concurrent and Distributed Computing</h5>
Distributed and concurrent algorithms and data structures
</br>
Synchronization protocols
</br>
Shared and transactional memory
</br>
Formal Methods, validation, verification, and synthesis
</br>
Peer-to-peer networks
</br>
Social networks
</br>
Game-theory and economical aspects of distributed computing
</br>
Randomization in distributed computing
</br>
Graph-theoretic concepts for communication networks, Dynamic networks, High-performance, cluster, cloud and grid computing.

<h5 class="utdallas">Track C. Mobile and Robot Computing</h5>

Self-organization in mobile agents, mobile robots, mobile sensor
networks, mobile ad-hoc networks, population protocols, programmable
particles, nanoscale robots, biological systems, and related new
models.

<h5 class="utdallas">Track D. Fault tolerance, Security, and Privacy</h5>

Network security
</br>
Privacy
</br>
Internet-of-things Security
</br>
Secure cloud computing
</br>
Mobile sensor networks/ad-hoc networks security
</br>
Verifiable/fault-tolerant computing
</br>
Anomaly and networked malware detection
</br>
Blockchain technologies and cryptocurrencies
</br>
Byzantine-fault tolerance and distributed consensus protocols
</br>
Secure multi-party computation
</br>
Applied cryptography

<h5 class="utdallas">IMPORTANT DATES</h5>
    Abstract Submission:      July 27, 2020 (11:59 PM AoE)
		<br>
    Paper Submission:         August 3, 2020 (11:59 PM AoE)
		<br>
    Acceptance Notification:  September 28, 2020
		<br>
    Camera-ready copy due:    October 9, 2020

<h5 class="utdallas">PAPER SUBMISSION</h5>
Papers are to be submitted electronically through EasyChair:
</br>
<a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sss2020">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sss2020</a>
</br>
All submission must conform to the formatting instructions of Springer LNCS series 
</br>

(see <a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines">https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines</a>).
</br>
Each submission must be in English, in PDF format.

<h5 class="utdallas">DOUBLE-BLIND REVIEW</h5>
We will experiment the double-blind peer review in SSS 2020. All
submissions must be anonymous. We will use a somewhat relaxed
implementation of double-blind peer review this year: you are free to
disseminate your work through arXiv and other online repositories and
give presentations on your work as usual. However, please make sure
you do not mention your own name or affiliation in the submission, and
please do not include obvious references in the text that reveal your identity. A
reviewer who has not previously seen the paper should be able to read
it without accidentally learning the identity of the authors. Please
feel free to ask the PC chairs if you have any questions about the
double-blind policy of SSS 2020.


<h5 class="utdallas">SUBMISSIONS</h5>
There are two types of submission: regular paper and brief announcement.
</br>
- A regular submission must not exceed 15 pages (including the title,
  authors, abstract, figures, and references). Additional necessary
  details for an expert to verify the main claims of the submission
  may be included in a clearly marked appendix if extra space is
  needed.
</br>
- A brief announcement submission must not exceed 5 pages and should
not include any appendix.
</br>
Any submission deviating from these guidelines will be rejected
without consideration of its merits. It is recommended that a regular
submission begins with a succinct statement of the problem being
addressed, a summary of the main results or conclusions, a brief
explanation of their significance, a brief statement of the key ideas,
and a comparison with related work, all tailored to a
non-specialist. Technical development of the work, directed to the
specialist, should follow. Papers outside of the conference scope will
be rejected without review. If requested by the authors on the cover
page, a regular submission that is not selected for a regular
presentation will also be considered for the brief announcement
format. This will not affect consideration of the paper for a regular
presentation.

<h5 class="utdallas">PUBLICATION</h5>
Regular papers and brief announcements will be included in the conference proceedings. Conference proceedings will be published by Springer in the LNCS conference series.

<h5 class="utdallas">SPECIAL ISSUE</h5>
Extended and revised versions of selected papers will be considered
for a special issue of an international journal.

<h5 class="utdallas">PAPER AWARD</h5>
Prizes will be given to the best regular paper and best student
 regular paper. A regular paper is eligible for the best student paper
 if at least one of its authors is a full-time student at submission
 time. Authors should clearly indicate whether their submission is
 eligible to be considered for the best student paper award (e.g.,
 using a \thanks in the title).  The PC may decline to confer awards
 or may split awards.
