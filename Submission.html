Papers are to be submitted electronically through EasyChair:
</br>
<a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sss2020">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sss2020</a>
</br>
All submission must conform to the formatting instructions of Springer LNCS series 
</br>

(see <a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines">https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines</a>).
</br>
Each submission must be in English, in PDF format.

<h5 class="utdallas">DOUBLE-BLIND REVIEW</h5>
We will experiment the double-blind peer review in SSS 2020. All
submissions must be anonymous. We will use a somewhat relaxed
implementation of double-blind peer review this year: you are free to
disseminate your work through arXiv and other online repositories and
give presentations on your work as usual. However, please make sure
you do not mention your own name or affiliation in the submission, and
please do not include obvious references in the text that reveal your identity. A
reviewer who has not previously seen the paper should be able to read
it without accidentally learning the identity of the authors. Please
feel free to ask the PC chairs if you have any questions about the
double-blind policy of SSS 2020.


<h5 class="utdallas">SUBMISSIONS</h5>
There are two types of submission: regular paper and brief announcement.
</br>
- A regular submission must not exceed 15 pages (including the title,
  authors, abstract, figures, and references). Additional necessary
  details for an expert to verify the main claims of the submission
  may be included in a clearly marked appendix if extra space is
  needed.
</br>
- A brief announcement submission must not exceed 5 pages and should
not include any appendix.
<p>
Any submission deviating from these guidelines will be rejected
without consideration of its merits. It is recommended that a regular
submission begins with a succinct statement of the problem being
addressed, a summary of the main results or conclusions, a brief
explanation of their significance, a brief statement of the key ideas,
and a comparison with related work, all tailored to a
non-specialist. Technical development of the work, directed to the
specialist, should follow. Papers outside of the conference scope will
be rejected without review. If requested by the authors on the cover
page, a regular submission that is not selected for a regular
presentation will also be considered for the brief announcement
format. This will not affect consideration of the paper for a regular
presentation.
</p>
<p>
Authors should consult Springer's authors'
<a href=ftp://ftp.springernature.com/cs-proceeding/svproc/guidelines/Springer_Guidelines_for_Authors_of_Proceedings.pdf> guidelines </a>  and use their proceedings templates, either for  <a href=ftp://ftp.springernature.com/cs-proceeding/llncs/llncs2e.zip> LaTeX </a>
 or for  <a href= ftp://ftp.springernature.com/cs-proceeding/llncs/word/splnproc1703.zip> Word </a>, for the preparation of their papers. Springer encourages authors to include their ORCIDs<https://goo.gl/hbsa4D>  in their papers. In addition, the corresponding author of each paper, acting on behalf of all of the authors of that paper, must complete and sign a Consent-to-Publish form. The corresponding author signing the copyright form should match the corresponding author marked on the paper. Once the files have been sent to Springer, changes relating to the authorship of the papers cannot be made.
